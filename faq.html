            <h3>Why is your Rockey Burger So Expensive?</h3>
            <p>We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like humanely-raised beef that is ground
                fresh each day, organic chicken, and Rockey Family Dairy's organic cream for our ice cream cones, sundays and
                shakes.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to freshness and quality means higher prices than you'd find at traditional fast-food burger
                chains. It also means food that tastes way better - because, well, it is.</p>

            <h3>Where does your beef come from?</h3>
            <p>We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local, family owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15%
                protein to fat blend, a mixture of lean protein and marbling found on in a cut of steak for our ground beef.
                The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our burgers taste so amazing.</p>
